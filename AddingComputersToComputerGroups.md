Many actions in VCL are done on computers in groups rather than directly on computers. Therefore, computers must be grouped together into computer groups. Computers are assigned to computer groups under Manage->Manage Computers->Edit Grouping. Access to this part of the site is granted by a user having computerAdmin at the same node where computer groups have the administer and manageGroup attribute set. The administer attribute controls which computers the user sees when doing the grouping. The manageGroup attribute controls which computer groups the user sees when doing the grouping.

Computers can be grouped by first selecting a computer, and then assigning the groups the computer is in. This is done under the **Group By Computer** tab. Multiple groups can be selected from the left or right boxes by holding down Ctrl while clicking on a group. Use the Add and Remove buttons to move groups between the boxes.
