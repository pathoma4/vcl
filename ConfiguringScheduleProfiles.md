Schedules are a type of resource in VCL. Schedules provide a way to when a computer is available for reservations. This is useful for computers that may need to be shared with a system external to VCL. Schedules were initially created so that campus computing lab computers could be reserved through VCL when the lab was closed. In this case, a schedule was created in VCL that made the computer available to VCL during the hours that the computing lab was closed. Schedules are defined on a weekly basis and are always in the timezone configured on the VCL web server.

Schedules are managed under Manage->Manage Schedules

Information about schedules is managed by then selecting Edit Schedule Profiles.

After giving the schedule a name and adding at least one start/end time, the **Add Schedule** button will create the schedule. At that point, the user will be prompted to add the schedule to a group.
