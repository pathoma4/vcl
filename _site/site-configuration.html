      <h1><a href="http://localhost:4000/">Site Configuration</a></h1> 


      <p>The site configuration settings provide a method for VCL administrators to change certain settings related to the VCL system and how it processes reservations. This is a new feature added in Apache VCL 2.4 and is located on the left navigation menu in the VCL web interface. The Additional User Permission (Privileges-&gt;Additional User Permissions) Site Configuration grants access to this portion of the site.</p>

As examples, if set to 24, a reservation for 23 hours would be timed out if a user remains disconnected for too long, and a reservation for 25 hours would not be timed out if a user remains disconnected for too long. <br />The duration after which a disconnected user is timed out is set by Re-connect To Reservation Timeout.<br /></td>
