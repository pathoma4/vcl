      <h1><a href="http://localhost:4000/">Advanced Image Options</a></h1> 


      <p>There are several advanced options for each image that can be modified. Normally, these options do not need to be modified. However, there are times where it is useful to modify them.</p>

<p>When a reservation is made, the VCL scheduler compares the following image settings to the corresponding settings of VCL computers in order to select a suitable computer for the image.  Configuring the following image settings allows you to restrict which computers may be assigned to reservations for the image.  Care should be taken when modifying these settings.  If any of these settings is configured to be so restrictive that none of the computers meet the image requirements, it will not be possible to make a reservation for the image.  When this is the case, users will be presented with a message stating There are no available times that the selected image can be used when attempting to make a reservation for the image:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;img src="images/selectionnotavailable.png" width="600" border="1"&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Required RAM (MB)</strong></td>
      <td><br />This is the minimum amount of RAM required for the image and is specified in megabytes (MB).  This is useful if the image has software installed that will not function properly unless the computer the image is loaded on contains a minimum amount of RAM.<br /><br /> When a reservation is made, the VCL scheduler compares the image’s Required RAM setting to the RAM setting of available computers.  Computers having a RAM setting less than the image’s Required RAM setting are ignored.  The scheduler will not assign a reservation to a computer that has a smaller RAM than the image’s Required RAM setting.<br /><br />For virtual machine images, a new virtual machine is instantiated when an image is loaded. This setting determines the amount of RAM the virtual machine will be configured to have.  There are cases where the virutual machine may be configured with more RAM than is configured for the image.  If the Required RAM setting of an image is less than the minimum required for the image’s operating system, VCL ensures that the operating system’s minimum RAM requirement is met.<br /></td>
