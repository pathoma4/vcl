    <ul>
      <li>Active Block Allocations - lists the number of block allocations with a currently active time slot</li>
      <li>Block Computer Usage - displays the number of reserved computers out of the total number of computers allocated to active block allocations - displayed in the form “x / y (z%)”</li>
      <li>Failed Block Computers - displays the number of failed computers out of the total number of computers allocated to active block allocations - displayed in the form “x / y (z%)”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Management Nodes</strong> - lists out all management nodes with the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>Time Since Check-in - time since the management node last checked in to the database; displayed in green if the time is &lt; 60 seconds, orange if the time is &lt; 2 minutes, red if &gt; 2 minutes; times greater than 24 hours are just displayed as “&gt; 24 hours”</li>
