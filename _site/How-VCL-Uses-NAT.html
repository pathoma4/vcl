      <h1><a href="http://localhost:4000/">How VCL Uses NAT</a></h1> 


      <p>VCL can make use of Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow users to connect to reserved systems via a single public IP address. This is done by configuring a node to act as a NAT host. VCL then configures networking rules on the NAT host so that users are given a port or set of ports to connect to on the NAT host that are then forwarded to the VCL node deployed for a given user. VCL dynamically configures the networking rules as nodes are provisioned and deprovisioned.</p>

<p>A NAT host must have at least 2 network adapters - one with an address on a network that each of the provisioned nodes will have an address, and another adapter with a publicly accessible address.</p>

<p>The NAT host must be configured to allow root to ssh to it from the management node. It is advisable to have this ssh process set up to listen on a 3rd network adapter configured to be on a private or control network.</p>

<p>NAT hosts are added to VCL under Manage Computers. The checkbox for <strong>Use as NAT Host</strong> must be selected and <strong>NAT Public IP Address</strong> and <strong>NAT Internal IP Address</strong> must be filled in with the IP addresses from the appropriate networks.</p>
