      <h1><a href="http://localhost:4000/">Mapping Image Groups to Computer Groups</a></h1> 


      <p>VCL must know about which images can be loaded on which computers. This is referred to as <strong>mapping</strong>, which is VCLâ€™s method of relating resource types to one another. Rather than directly relating images to computers, image groups are mapped to computer groups. This is done under Manage-&gt;Manage Images-&gt;Edit Grouping &amp; Mapping. Access to this part of the site is granted by a user having imageAdmin and computerAdmin at the same node where image and computer groups both have the manageMapping attribute set.</p>

<p>Once on the Grouping &amp; Mapping page, users with access will see tabs titled <strong>Map By Image Group</strong> and <strong>Map By Computer Group.</strong></p>

<p>Mapping can be done by first selecting an image group, then assigning which computer groups are mapped to it. This is done under the <strong>Map By Image Group</strong> tab. Multiple computer groups can be selected from the left or right boxes by holding down Ctrl while clicking on a computer group. Use the Add and Remove buttons to move computer groups between the boxes.</p>

<p>Mapping can also be done by first selecting a computer group, then assigning which image groups are mapped to it. This is done under the <strong>Map By Computer Group</strong> tab. Multiple image groups can be selected from the left or right boxes by holding down Ctrl while clicking on an image group. Use the Add and Remove buttons to move image groups between the boxes.</p>
