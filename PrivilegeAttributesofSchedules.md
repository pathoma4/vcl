Because schedules are assigned directly to computers, access to schedules is not directly granted to users. Therefore, the **available** attribute cannot be assigned for schedules under the Privilege tree. Additionally, the **manageMapping** attribute is not assigned either since schedules are not mapped to computers. The **administer** and **manageGrouping** attributes can be assigned to control which administrative users have access to manage various schedules.
