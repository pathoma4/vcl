In addition to the primary set of [User Permissions](resources-groups-privileges.html#user-permissions), there are several additional permissions that can be granted to user groups. These are things that don't make sense to have tied to a particular privilege node because they aren't directly used in conjunction with resources. They are accessed under Privileges -> Additional User Group Permissions.
