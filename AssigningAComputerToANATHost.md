After a computer or management node has been configured to be a NAT host, computers can be configured to be connected to using NAT.

## Managing a Single Computer

Under Manage Computers->Edit Computer Profiles, select Edit for a desired computer. In the dialog box that is displayed, there is a box toward the bottom for setting the NAT host. Check the box for **Connect Using NAT** and select the desired **NAT Host** from the drop down box.

## Managing Multiple Computers

Multiple computers can have their NAT settings changed at once using the **Actions for selected computers** drop down. First, select several computers. Selection can be done either using the checkboxes, CTRL+clicking rows, or clicking a row and then Shift+clicking another row to select all rows between the two rows.
