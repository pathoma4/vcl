Resources are often acted on within VCL via **resource groups** rather than doing thing directly with the resources themselves. All resources have a method by which they are placed into groups that is done under the management set of pages for each specific resource type.

Resource groups themselves and added, edited, and deleted under **Manage Groups** further down the page from where user groups are displayed.

Each resource group has three attributes:

* **Type** - The type of the resource group (computer, image, etc). This is set when the group is created and cannot be changed after creation.
* **Name** - The name given to the user group for selecting it in other parts of the site.
* **Owning User Group** - This is a user group designated as having ownership of the group. Users that are members of the owning user group can modify both the name and the owning user group of the resource group. *Note: Users in the owning user group are generally considered as owners of the resources in the group along with whoever is directly set as the owner of each resource. This gives them the same access to do things with the resource as the directly set owner has (modifying profile data, managing the grouping of the resource, etc).
