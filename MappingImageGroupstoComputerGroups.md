VCL must know about which images can be loaded on which computers. This is referred to as **mapping**, which is VCL's method of relating resource types to one another. Rather than directly relating images to computers, image groups are mapped to computer groups. This is done under Manage->Manage Images->Edit Grouping & Mapping. Access to this part of the site is granted by a user having imageAdmin and computerAdmin at the same node where image and computer groups both have the manageMapping attribute set.

Once on the Grouping & Mapping page, users with access will see tabs titled **Map By Image Group** and **Map By Computer Group.**

Mapping can be done by first selecting an image group, then assigning which computer groups are mapped to it. This is done under the **Map By Image Group** tab. Multiple computer groups can be selected from the left or right boxes by holding down Ctrl while clicking on a computer group. Use the Add and Remove buttons to move computer groups between the boxes.
