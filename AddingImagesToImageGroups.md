Many actions in VCL are done on images in groups rather than directly on images. Therefore, images must be grouped together into image groups. Images are assigned to image groups under Manage->Manage Images->Edit Grouping & Mapping. Access to this part of the site is granted by a user having imageAdmin at the same node where image groups have the administer and manageGroup attribute set. The administer attribute controls which images the user sees when doing the grouping. The manageGroup attribute controls which image groups the user sees when doing the grouping.

Images can be grouped by first selecting an image, and then assigning the groups the image is in. This is done under the Group By Image tab. Multiple groups can be selected from the left or right boxes by holding down Ctrl while clicking on a group. Use the Add and Remove buttons to move groups between the boxes.
